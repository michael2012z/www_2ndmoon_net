These locomotives are fueled by burning some combustible material, usually coal, wood or oil, to produce steam in a boiler, which drives the steam engine. Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons pulled behind.%0a%0aSteam locomotives were first developed in Britain and dominated railway transportation until the middle of the 20th century. From the early 1900s they were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives.%0a%0a----%0a!! Origins%0a!!!

The people who undertook this journey were unknowing pioneers - they were the first railway passengers in world history.%0a%0a!!!

Accompanied with Andrew Vivian, it ran with mixed success. The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area in 1804 and he had a ready audience of colliery owners and engineers. The visit was so successful that the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of the steam locomotive.%0a%0a%0a%25rframe width=200%25 [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Stephenson%2527s_Rocket_drawing.jpg | http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Stephenson%2527s_Rocket_drawing.jpg]] | [- Trevithick's locomotive -]%0a%0aIn 1825 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, north-east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world. In 1829, he built The Rocket which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. This success led to Stephenson establishing his company as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives used on railways in the United Kingdom, United States and much of Europe.%0a\\%0a\\%0a\\%0a%0a!!!

Built in June 1816 by Johann Friedrich Krigar in the Royal Berlin Iron Foundry (Königlichen Eisengießerei zu Berlin), the locomotive ran on a circular track in the factory yard. It was the first locomotive to be built on the European mainland and the first steam-powered passenger service, because curious onlookers could ride in the attached coaches for a fee.%0a%3c %0a%3c %25rframe width=200%25 [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/KFNB_Austria.jpg/800px-KFNB_Austria.jpg | http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/KFNB_Austria.jpg/800px-KFNB_Austria.jpg]] | [- The first locomotive in Austria -]%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1837 the first steam railway started up in Austria on the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway between Vienna-Floridsdorf and Deutsch-Wagram. %0a%3c %0a%3c In 1838 the third steam locomotive to be built in Germany, the Saxonia, was manufactured by the Maschinenbaufirma Übigau near Dresden, built by Prof. Johann Andreas Schubert.

Accompanied with Andrew Vivian, it ran with mixed success. The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area in 1804 and he had a ready audience of colliery owners and engineers. The visit was so successful that the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of the steam locomotive.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %25rframe width=200%25 [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Stephenson%2527s_Rocket_drawing.jpg | http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Stephenson%2527s_Rocket_drawing.jpg]] | [- Trevithick's locomotive -]%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1825 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, north-east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world.
