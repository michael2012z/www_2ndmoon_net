text=[+++Wheel arrangement+++] is a system of classifying the way in which wheels are distributed beneath a locomotive.[1] Several notations exist to describe the wheel assemblies of a locomotive by type, position, and connections, with the adopted notations varying by country. Within a given country, different notations may also be employed for different kinds of locomotives, such as steam, electric, and diesel powered.%0a%0aEspecially in steam days, wheel arrangement was an important attribute of a locomotive because there were many different types of layout adopted, each wheel being optimised for a different use (often with only some being actually "driven"). Modern diesel and electric locomotives are much more uniform, usually with all axles driven.%0a%0aThe main notations are the Whyte notation (based on counting the wheels), the AAR wheel arrangement notation (based on counting either the axles or the bogies), and the UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements (based on counting either the axles or the bogies):\\%0a%0a* [[Locomotive.AARWheelArrangement | AAR wheel arrangement]] - Used largely throughout the US and Canada for diesel and electric locomotives.%0a* [[Locomotive.UICWheelArrangement | UIC classification]] - Used in mainland Europe for all locomotive types.
