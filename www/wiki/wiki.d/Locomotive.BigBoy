The 25 Big Boys were the only locomotives to have the 4-8-8-4 wheel arrangement, which combined two sets of eight driving wheels with a four-wheel leading truck for stability entering curves and a four-wheel trailing truck to support the large firebox.%0a%0aUnion Pacific Railroad (UP) introduced the Challenger-type (4-6-6-4) locomotives in 1936 on its main line across Wyoming. For most of the way, the maximum grade is 0.82%25 in either direction, but the climb eastward from Ogden, Utah, into the Wasatch Range (Wahsatch, on the railroad) reached 1.14%25. Hauling a 3,600-short ton (3,300 t) freight train demanded doubleheading and helper operations, and adding and removing the helper engines from a train slowed operations.%0a%0aThe answer was to design a new locomotive, but for such locomotives to be worthwhile they had to be faster and more powerful than slow mountain luggers like the earlier compound 2-8-8-0s that UP tried after World War I. To avoid locomotive changes, the new class would need to pull long trains at sustained speed—60 miles per hour (100 km/h)—once past the mountain grades. (The 1950s Wyoming Div timetables allowed them 50 mph or less, passenger or freight.)%0a%0aLed by Otto Jabelmann, the UP's design team worked with Alco to re-examine the Challengers, which had been designed by A.H. Fetters. They found that the goals could be achieved by making several changes to the Challenger design, including enlarging the firebox to about 235 by 96 inches (6.0 m × 2.4 m) (about 155 sq ft/14.4 m2), lengthening the boiler, adding four driving wheels and reducing the size of the driving wheels from 69 to 68 in (1.753 to 1.727 m).%0a%0aThe Big Boys are articulated, like the Mallet locomotive design. They were designed for stability at 60 miles per hour (100 km/h). They were built with a heavy margin of reliability and safety, as they normally operated well below that speed in freight service. Peak horsepower was reached at about 35 mph (56 km/h); optimal tractive effort, at about 10 mph (16 km/h).%0aWithout the tender, the Big Boy had the largest engine body of all reciprocating steam locomotives.%0a%0aTwenty-five Big Boys were built, in two groups of ten and one of five. All burned coal, and had large grates to burn the low-quality Wyoming coal from mines owned by the railroad.%0a%0aAs an experiment, Locomotive 4005 was converted to burn oil, but unlike a similar effort with the Challenger types, this was not successful, and the locomotive was soon changed back to coal. The cited reason for this failure was the use of a single burner, which created unsatisfactory and uneven heating in the Big Boy's large firebox. It is unknown why multiple burners were not employed, though with dieselization in full swing after 1945 the company probably lost interest in further development of steam.%0a%0aThe last revenue train hauled by a Big Boy ended its run early in the morning on July 21, 1959. Most were stored operational until 1961, and four remained in operational condition at Green River, Wyoming until 1962. Their duties were assumed by diesels and turbines.%0a%0a%0a%25lframe width=540%25 [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Big_Boy_4023.jpg/948px-Big_Boy_4023.jpg | http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Big_Boy_4023.jpg/948px-Big_Boy_4023.jpg]]%0a%0a%25lframe width=540%25 [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Big_Boy_4012.jpg | http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Big_Boy_4012.jpg]]%0a%0a%25lframe width=540%25 [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Big_Boy_4006.jpg/1024px-Big_Boy_4006.jpg | http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Big_Boy_4006.jpg/1024px-Big_Boy_4006.jpg]]
