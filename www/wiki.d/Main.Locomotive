text=! What is Locomotive?%0a%0aA locomotive is a railway vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. The word originates from the Latin loco â€“ "from a place", ablative of locus, "place" + Medieval Latin motivus, "causing motion", and is a shortened form of the term locomotive engine, first used in the early 19th century to distinguish between mobile and stationary steam engines.\\%0a%0a%25width=560px newwin%25 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/R707-loco-victorian-railways.jpg/1024px-R707-loco-victorian-railways.jpg | [-R707 steam locomotive of Victorian Railways-]%0a%0a----%0a%0a! What Locomotive is NOT?%0a%0aA locomotive has no payload capacity of its own, and its sole purpose is to move the train along the tracks. In contrast, some trains have self-propelled payload-carrying vehicles. These are not normally considered locomotives, and may be referred to as multiple units, motor coaches or railcars. The use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight (see CargoSprinter). Vehicles which provide motive power to haul an unpowered train, but are not generally considered locomotives because they have payload space or are rarely detached from their trains, are known as power cars.\\%0a%0a%25width=560px newwin%25 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Waldbahn_VT_15.jpg/1024px-Waldbahn_VT_15.jpg | [-Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 railcar-]%0a%0a----%0a%0a!

While the capital cost of electrifying track is high, electric trains and locomotives are capable of higher performance and lower operational costs than steam or diesel power. Electric locomotives, because they tend to be less technically complex than diesel-electric locomotives, are both easier and cheaper to maintain and have extremely long working lives, usually 40 to 50 years: the last unit of the Italian E626 class, introduced in 1928, was retired 71 years later, in 1999. \\\%0aA French TGV holds the world speed record for the fastest wheeled train, having reached 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) on 3 April 2007.\\\%0aSome electric locomotives can also operate off battery power to enable short journeys or shunting on non-electrified lines or yards. Battery-powered locomotives are used in mines and other underground locations where diesel fumes or smoke would endanger crews, and where external electricity supplies cannot be used due to the danger of sparks igniting flammable gas. Battery locomotives are also used on many underground railways for maintenance operations, as they are required when operating in areas where the electricity supply has been temporarily disconnected.%0a%0a!!

The use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight (see CargoSprinter). Vehicles which provide motive power to haul an unpowered train, but are not generally considered locomotives because they have payload space or are rarely detached from their trains, are known as power cars.%0a

In contrast, some trains have self-propelled payload-carrying vehicles. These are not normally considered locomotives, and may be referred to as multiple units, motor coaches or railcars.
